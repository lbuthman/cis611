- a calculator has buttons and a "screen" to display output
- buttons can be operands (with a special decimal operand) or operators (with a special equals operator)
    - operands construct values (integers, decimal)
    - operators alter operands to produce results
    - results are calculating with "equals" operator or //
        operator entered, operand entered, operator entered, operand entered (result produced)
- the default operand is 0
- a new operand is constructed as operand buttons are pressed, until an operator is selected or
    a MAX_DIGITS has been reached
- the special operand (.) results in an error if pressed twice (pressed while true) -->
    an error message is displayed temporarily and then the previous valid operand is shown
- check for divide by 0 error
- check for negative square root error
- square root should show (if not too difficult) +-
- "hi" produces 07734
- handle really big and really small numbers

Process

1. get operands and display
2. validate operands (MAX_DIGITS, leading zero, double decimal)
3. implement clear buttons "CE" "AC"
4. implement basic version of Equals, returns current value of operand
5. implement addition
6. implement subtraction
